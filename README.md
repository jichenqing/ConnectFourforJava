# ConnectFourforJava

Develop a console-only Connect Four game in Java individually, which is built with Swing GUI toolkit. The user can load a game from a text file that consists of a Connectfour game as a String, start a new game, as well as save the game locally. This is also a practice for demonstrating the principles of inheritance by first building a Tic Tac Toe game then deriving the Connect Four game from the Tic Tac Toe.
